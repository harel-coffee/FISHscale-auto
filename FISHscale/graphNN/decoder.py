# 1 HEXBIN data to get a multinomial distribution of genes per HEX. Phg(H, G).
    # This could be replaced by a general Pg(G) multinomial, to make an even 
    # more generalized model
# 2 Lose identity of a certain percentage of all molecules Pl(L). 
# 3 Modify normalized attention probabilities to introduce knowckout (or overexpression).
    # Do N times until full expansion
    # 3.1 Expand expression spatially following the multinomial probabilities by the 
    #    restricted neighbor attention.
# 4 Check the new HEXBIN distributions
