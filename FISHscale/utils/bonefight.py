        This is a wrapper around BoneFight to make implementation with 
        FISHscale data easier. Made for 2D data (genes by observations).
        For more advanced features, use Bonefight directly.
        Observations could be cells, clusters, groups, tiles, FOVs etc.

        Args:
            X_1 (Pandas dataframe or np.ndarray): Preferred a Pandas dataframe 
                with features as rows, with names in the index. And 
                observations in columns. Alternatively a numpy array.
            volume_1 (np.ndarray): Volume prior for X_1 for each column of X_1.

                Pandas dataframe with features as rows, with names in the 
                index. And observations in columns. Alternatively a numpy array
                can be provided in the same format, in which case, make sure 
                the order of the index is identical with X_1.
                If None is provided a hexagonal bin will be made of the data
                which will be used as X_2. Defaults to None.
            volume_2 ([np.ndarray], optional): Volume prior for X_1 for each 
                column of X_1. If X_2 and volume_2 are set to None it will make
                the volumes equal by passing an array of ones. 
                Defaults to None.
            transform (bool, optional): If True transform the data and returns
                the transformed tensor. Defaults to False.
            plot (bool, optional): If True plots the loss function.
                Defaults to False.
            spacing (float, optional): If X_2 is None, makes hexagonal bins
                with this spacing. Defaults to 100.
            min_count (int, optional): If X_2 is None, makes hexagonal bins
                with min_count. Defaults to 10.
